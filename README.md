# Movie-Comparison-App
An app that compares the stats of two movies (like box office return and Metascore) to determine which movie is "better". From the Colt Steele Modern JS Course on Udemy.

## Things I Learned
* Fetching and displaying data from a movie database API called OMDB API with Axios
* Using a CSS framework called Bulma CSS to style the app's UI
* Using a debounce method to prevent too many calls to the OMDB movie API

## To-Do List
- [ ] Improve the styling on the list so that the comparative elements always line up
